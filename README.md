## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software developer interested in building reliable, efficient, and well-structured software systems. I enjoy working across different layers of the stack—from backend APIs and databases to exploring how software behaves at the system level.

Much of my work involves Python, Java, C, and modern web frameworks, and I’m always looking for opportunities to learn new technologies through hands-on projects and real-world applications.

## 📂 Projects

### **Insurance Policy Checker**
- Co-developed a full-stack NLP-based application to automate insurance policy data comparison, reducing processing time.  
- Implemented scalable backend with FastAPI and PostgreSQL, deployed via Docker for seamless integration and portability.  
- Designed responsive frontend using React, enhancing user interaction and accessibility.

### **AI Player Queen of Amazons**
- Developed an AI agent that plays Queen of Amazons with other agents on UBC servers.  
- Implemented using Java and Minimax algorithm.  
- The agent was fast and efficient since we limited the depth of exploration and used alpha beta pruning.

### **Multi-Object Tracking**
- Built a machine learning model for real-time pedestrian tracking using YOLOv8 and Kalman filtering.  
- Integrated MiDaS for depth estimation on 2D datasets.  
- Documented model architecture and results, enabling reproducibility and future enhancements.

### **AI-Powered Resume Builder**
- Developed a full-stack web app with React and FastAPI to tailor resumes using the OpenAI API for dynamic content generation.  
- Engineered RESTful APIs with PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy ORM) to manage user profiles and job descriptions.  
- Implemented LaTeX-based PDF generation for professional resume formatting.  
- Containerized using Docker and docker-compose for streamlined development and deployment.

### **SQLite Database Internals** *(Learning Project)*  
- Studying core database concepts including storage engines and query processing.  
- Exploring low-level data structures and system performance optimization.  
- Repository: [sqlite-internals](https://github.com/AllanCheboiwo/sqlite-internals)
